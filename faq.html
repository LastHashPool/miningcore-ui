                                    Pool and miner hashrates are re-calculated every ten minutes. Therefore it can take a maximum of ten minutes for your hashrate
                                    to update depending on the submission time of your first valid share. The hashrate we
                                    display at the pool is a rough approximation of your hashrate based on your submitted
                                    shares and can therefore differ significantly from the hashrate displayed locally. When
                                    in doubt always consider the value displayed by your miner as the correct one.

                                    <p>All of our pools utilize the PPLNS payment system. PPLNS is short for "Pay Per Last N
                                        Shares". The image below illustrates the system. One round has an arbitrary number
                                        of shares which is solely based on sheer luck. Proportional reward systems only consider
                                        shares of one round when calculating rewards. PPLNS however, uses a quite constant
                                        number N of shares for calculating rewards. This number N changes only with the difficulty:</p>
                                    <p>
                                        <img src="https://www.coinfoundry.org/img/shares_round.png" alt="PPLNS">
                                    </p>
                                    <p>As you know the number of shares needed to solve a block within a round is different.
                                        Round one and three needed
                                        <em>(difficulty * 2)</em> shares to be solved. Round two and four are quite short rounds.
                                        There were less than
                                        <em>(difficulty * 2)</em> shares necessary to solve them. Round five however is a very
                                        long round which means the pool needed more than
                                        <em>(difficulty * 2)</em> shares to solve the block. From this follows that:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Rounds one and three are like proportional rounds. All of your shares from the given
                                            round are considered for reward calculations</li>
                                        <li>For rounds two and four, shares from the previous rounds are considered for calculations
                                            as well (marked green). In other words: regardless of round boundaries we always
                                            consider the last
                                            <em>(difficulty * 2)</em> shares. Your portion of the amount of shares is used to
                                            calculate your reward.</li>
                                        <li>Round five however is very long. In this round your lowermost shares (within the
                                            marked red part) are silently dropped if they are not within the last
                                            <em>(difficulty * 2)</em> shares.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>PPLNS favors constant and/or occasional loyal pool members over pool hoppers.</strong>
                                        Pool hoppers are betting for a "quick win" (like round two above) with low shares per round. If the round exceeds a certain
                                        amount of shares they "hop" to another proportional pool which started a new round
                                        more recently. This assures better rewards for pool hoppers over occasional or constant
                                        miners which are loyal to their pool. Pool hopping however implies that pool hoppers
                                        need to know when a round is started and how much shares are considered for reward.
                                        This is very easy with proportional reward system. While using PPLNS, this is no
                                        longer true. On long rounds (like round five above) the pool hoppers shares won’t
                                        be considered for reward calculations in favor of loyal miners. This is due to the
                                        fact that pool hoppers only mine on the beginning of rounds. On short and normal
                                        rounds pool hoppers won’t lose their shares. Due to the fact that shares from previous
                                        rounds from loyal miners are considered
                                        <strong>twice</strong> (or even more often on extremely short rounds) the pool hopper won’t
                                        get the same reward as from proportional reward system.</p>

                                        after the block has reached a mature status. This may take a couple hours, depending
                                        on the coin. As soon as a block can be considered 'mature' by the pool, your shares
                                        will be used to calculate your contribution towards finding the block. The more you've
                                        contributed, the higher your cut of the block reward will be. Your cut of the block
                                        reward will then be credited to your pending balance. If your balance reaches or
                                        exceeds the pool's minimum payout amount, the pool will transfer your

                                    <p>We are a small pool for the time being, and as such it may take some time to find a block.
                                        On larger pools you would see some balance earlier because they will find blocks
                                        faster, but you will get a smaller share of the reward than what you would in a smaller
                                        pool. Over time you will earn more or less the same amount when mining on a large
                                        pool or on a small one.</p>
                                    <p>In other words, the rewards you get on average are exactly proportional to your part
                                        in the total work done by the pool. If you mine in a pool
                                        <strong>twice as large</strong>, the pool will collect twice as much rewards but your share
                                        in them will be
                                        <strong>cut by half</strong>, meaning you get the same on average.</p>
                                    <p>Trustworthiness, reliability, support and low latency are the things you should consider
                                        when choosing a pool. By avoiding the largest pools you contribute to the network
                                        health by spreading the hash power.</p>
